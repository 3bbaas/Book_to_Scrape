Get a copy of a public record for a young man whose only friend has died in an unexplained accidental death. Except... The police file regarding the demise of sex worker Tanya Everly has been sealed by the order of the chief of police, and no one will talk. Warned to drop the matter, Attorney Morgan knows that if he doesn't speak for the dead young woman, no one will.
