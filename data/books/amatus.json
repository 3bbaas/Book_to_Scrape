  "description": "Crispian, who has lived in a city of darkness all his life, must make a choice: remain safe in his home, but forever wonder what the mysterious light on the horizon could be--or trust a young woman to guide him to a wonderful realm he's never seen, and risk being deceived and led to a terrible death.",
